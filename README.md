Converts a manual router speed controller to CNC control by connecting the potentiometer of the controller to a servo.  The servo is controlled by an Arduino board connected to the parallel port.  The Arduino decodes the PWM from the computer into a servo position.

The speed controller used for testing was purchased from Harbor Freight here:
